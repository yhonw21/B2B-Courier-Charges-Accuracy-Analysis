# B2B Courier Charges Accuracy Analysis using Python

In today's fast-paced e-commerced industry, fast and efficient order delivery is crucial to business success. To ensure seamless order fulfilment, businesses often partner with courier companies to ship their products to customers. However, managing the charges collected by these courier companies can be difficult, especially when dealing with a high volumen of orders. It is one of the real-time problems B2B businesses experience when their estimated charges for the same invoice don't match.

B2B courier charges accuracy analysis focuses on assessing the accuracy of fees charges by courier companies for the delivery of goods in B2B transactions. The aim is to ensure that companies are billed appropriately for the services provided by courier companies.
